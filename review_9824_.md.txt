Content is excellent.
Consitencty and quality of visuall presentation is very good. ( I would prefer if the background was not blank, however, I apprectiate that there are pictures in it. However, I would also prefer if the pictures were put in in a more consistent way).
Quatlity of written presentation is excellent.
HTLM is valid
Author info was not written but the actual author, and author details and links to github pages and linked in are present where they exist. It looks like the contributions from members are also reasonably balanced, when considering that the whole set up needs to be set up by one person and that the project is not that big so there is not much time for the other people to catch up. This project was also not completed last minute so overall all in this section I am going to give them Outstanding.
